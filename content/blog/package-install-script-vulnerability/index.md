title: "Package Install Script Vulnerability"
date: "2019-11-27"
spoiler: You should disable execution of arbitrary code when installing npm packages.

It's possible for an npm package to execute **arbitrary code** in its installation:

```json{3}
//package.json
"scripts": {
    "postinstall": "virus.js"
}
```

This can happen every time a package it's installed. We haven't seen an outbreak of a virus using the vulnerability yet.

> According to [Richard Feldman](https://twitter.com/rtfeldman) (where I learned about this), the main reason this hasn't happened yet is _because it hasn't happened yet_.

Luckly we can be safe from this by ignoring the execution of scripts:

```bash
npm config set ignore-scripts true
```

So do yourself a favor and run this :)
